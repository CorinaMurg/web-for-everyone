                    <span className="stats">Half</span> of the home pages tested had links without proper text descriptions.
                    This is a problem because screen reader users rely on link text to understand the context

                        Instead of reading through the entire page, some screen reader users prefer to
                        navigate through the various links provided on the page. As a result,
                        the links are announced separately from their surrounding text and

                        typically read out the aria-label instead of the visible text.

                    This issue is very similar to empty links: users can struggle to understand the purpose of a

                        Use both text and image, but add a <code>visually-hidden</code> class to the text. Screen readers 
                        will announce the text, while sighted users will rely on the image to figure out the 
                        purpose of the button.

                        Keep just the image, but include its description within the <code>alt</code> attribute (e.g., 
                        <code> alt="Close modal</code>). This version will be more verbose, so less than ideal.
                        It will be announced as "close modal graphic button."
