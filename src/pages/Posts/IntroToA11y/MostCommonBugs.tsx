                    When images lack the <code>alt</code> attribute,

                <h2>3. Empty Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Half of the home pages tested had links without proper text descriptions.
                    This is a problem because screen reader users rely on link text to understand the context 
                    and the destination of a link.

                    <p>Vague link text like "click here" or "continue" is not very helpful either. 
                        Screen readers announce links separately from their surrounding text. As a result, 
                        users can struggle to understand the purpose of a link if its text is vague.

                    <p className="gray-bg">
                        The <code>aria-label</code> can provide a 
                        more descriptive alternative. If you use it, screen readers will 
                        typically read out the aria-label instead of the visible text.

                <p>
                    More than a quarter of the home pages tested had buttons without proper text descriptions.
                    This issue is very similar to empty links: users can struggle to understand the purpose of a 
                    button if its text is vague or missing.

                <p>
                    More than a third of form inputs were not properly labeled.
                    Without labels, users of assistive technologies struggle to understand the purpose of 
                    form inputs.

                    When the language of a document isn't specified, it can affect how screen readers pronounce content,
