                                The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
                                are the international standards for web accessibility. 
                                They are not an easy read, but they become one with practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The guidelines have three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA.
                                Level A provides only the most basic level of accessibility, and the 
                                recommended level for most websites is AA (which requires that level A has also been met).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some guidelines are staggered across all three levels, while others are specific to just one level or two.
                                For example, the requirement that every web page has a title is a level A, 
                                while the target size for clickable areas has both level AA and AAA requirements. For the AA level,
                                any clickable area must be of minimum 24 by 24 pixels. For the AAA level, the minimum size must be 44 by 44 pixels.
