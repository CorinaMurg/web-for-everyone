            `Buttons and links are fundamental elements in web design, each with distinct semantic 
            meanings and accessibility implications. Semantic meaning refers to the message
            HTML elements convey, particularly users of assistive technologies.`,
            `Therefore, for accessibility (and beyond!), it's essential to use the appropriate 
            element given the functionality you aim to implement. Let’s see how to use them!`,
