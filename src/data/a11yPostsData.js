        "description": `While rem units are often championed for their scalability, particularly for 
            text to aid with zoom and accessibility, they may not be the best choice for margins, padding, 
            and spacing. Read Ashlee M Boyer's post on how using px units in these cases can 
            lead to a more predictable and user-friendly layout.`,

        researchers on the accessibility potential of AI tools. The study found mixed results; while AI helped 
        in some tasks, such as summarizing texts and composing messages, it also frequently produced errors
